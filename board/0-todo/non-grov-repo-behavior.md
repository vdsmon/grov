# Behavior on non-grov-initialized repos

What happens when you run grov commands on a non-grov-initialized repo?

- What if there is no bare repo? Should it fail?
- If there is a bare repo, what if the name is not `repo.git`?
- What if the name is `repo.git` but it was not initialized by grov (no `.grov.toml`)?
